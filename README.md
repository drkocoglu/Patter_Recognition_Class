Summary:
- This repository includes the pattern recognition class assignments I completed in the Electrical & Computer Engineering department at Texas Tech University.
- The assignments require the user to develop the algorithms from scratch meaning, there will either be very limited or no use of other existing libraries.
- The assignments were solved in MATLAB.
